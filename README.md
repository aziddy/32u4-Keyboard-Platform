# 32u4-Keyboard-Platform
Macro Keyboard Platform that uses Serial and EEPROM to configure a keyboard instead of flashing firmware

This allows a 32u4 macro keyboard to be configured from platforms where 32u4 toolchain is not avaiable and also allows layout configuration programs to be made with simple Serial commands


Only problem is that EEPROM on boards like 32u4 are can only only be written to finite amount of times. So sacrifices will be made on layout customization
